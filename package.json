  "description": "Pong Challenge was a groundbreaking project that combined the classic Pong game with a twist. Unlike the traditional version where you face off against one ball, in Pong Challenge, multiple balls appear on the screen, making it a thrilling and challenging experience. The aim was to create an intelligent AI function to control the paddle and prevent the balls from getting past it.",
